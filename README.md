# steamworks-lockstep
Gamemaker sample project that combines SteamWorks with Lockstep

This project fuses together the excellent [Steamworks.gml](https://github.com/YellowAfterlife/steamworks.gml) with [Lockstep](https://meseta.itch.io/lockstep) to achieve online multiplayer that runs perfectly in sync.
It's well suited to games that can tolerate higher latency such as strategy games.

You will need the [Steamworks SDK](https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/sdk) installed in order to run.
This is alpha status so expect some bugs.
